A [new study][link] conducted by the Institute for the Future has uncovered a disturbing truth about America’s journalists, namely that they are just as susceptible to falling for misinformation as any other group in the United States. More than 80% of more than 1000 journalists that were surveyed affirmed that they had been fooled by misinformation online. What’s more, only 15% reported having received any work-related training on how to spot online misinformation. The report further found that older Americans were more likely to be fooled than their younger counterparts.
