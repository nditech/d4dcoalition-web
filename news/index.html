        <p>New legal authority that allows for “clandestine military activity” in cyberspace, is being utilized to place potentially crippling malware inside Russia’s electric grid, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html">the New York Times reports.</a> This “aggressive” posture is in response to Russia inserting malware into parts of America’s energy infrastructure. Such repositioning runs the risk of escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow and reopens the debate as to whether a nation’s power grid is a legitimate target for cyberattacks.</p>

              Tweets That Chill: Analyzing Online Violence Against Women in Politics
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>D4D member NDI’s Gender, Women, and Democracy team undertook a <a href="https://www.ndi.org/tweets-that-chill">unique study</a> to explore the effect of gender-based violence, as expressed toward college-age, politically-active women on Twitter in three countries - Indonesia, Colombia, and Kenya. In these three countries, NDI worked with a number of women in politics, and civic technology and women’s rights organizations to examine the country-and context-specific challenges women face, as they engage in political discourse. The report finds that online violence against women in politics led to women pausing, decreasing, or completely stopping their Twitter activity. It also highlights the additional need for research to understand and mitigate the impact of violence against women in politics. NDI hopes these findings will be used to inform changes to social media platform policies and global legal and political frameworks.</p>

        <p>In a new report,  the European Union’s (EU) Commission and the High Representative provides <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/joint_report_on_disinformation.pdf">an initial assessment</a> of how the implementation of its Action Plan Against Disinformation and the Elections Package has fared. The report states that the EU strengthened its capabilities to detect, analyze, and expose disinformation; improved coordinated responses; implemented a self-regulatory code of practice on disinformation; improved societal resilience, and; has worked to protect the integrity of elections. It concludes that while there has been progress, more human and financial resources and a joint EU effort are needed to further protect our democratic processes and institutions.</p>

        <p>U.S. lawmakers want <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/lawmakers-urge-examination-money-china-surveillance-tech">a deeper investigation</a> into the reported investment of two startups developing technology used for Chinese facial recognition surveillance by U.S. public pension funds, universities, and foundations. As BuzzFeed News <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/us-money-funding-facial-recognition-sensetime-megvii">initially reported</a>, venture capital or private equity firms used funds, entrusted by US institutional investors, to invest in SenseTime and Megvii. The Chinese government is allegedly using technology developed by these companies to surveil its citizens, including in Xinjiang where Chinese authorities have detained Uighur Muslims  and other ethnic minorities in internment camps.</p>

              Symantec Report Finds Russia&#39;s Manipulation of Twitter Larger Than Believed
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Research Symantec, a cybersecurity firm, concluded that Russia’s infamous troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, may not only have reached more users than previously thought, but may also have generated income for some of the phony accounts, some earning as much as $1 million. <a href="https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/twitterbots-propaganda-disinformation">The analysis</a> also found that while most accounts were automated, many were manually manipulated in an effort to dodge detection. It also found that fake accounts targeted partisans on both ends of the political spectrum and most pretended to be regional news outlets. The Symantec report comes as they are evaluating the impact of interference attempts on the European Parliament election that took place at the end of May. Politico offers a contextual summary <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/05/study-russia-cybersecurity-twitter-1353543">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center builds upon its February 2018 initial publication to release the <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Democratic_Defense_Against_Disinformation_2.0.pdf">Democratic Defense Against Disinformation 2.0</a> paper. This paper reviews developments to counter disinformation over the past year and provides recommendations for next steps.While it recognizes the efforts by democracies to shift from “admiring the problem” to efforts to testing new ideas and solutions, and building resilience against disinformation, it also acknowledges that disinformation is also evolving and advancing. Recommendations in this report include policies and actions to limit the influx of disinformation and investing in long-term social resilience against disinformation, including digital literacy education and raising social awareness. It also recommends the establishment of a U.S/E.U Counter-Disinformation Coalition to bring together government and non-government stakeholders and a voluntary code of conduct outlining principles and agreed procedures for dealing with disinformation.</p>

              The Danger of Deepfakes Grows: Nancy Pelosi Targeted in Viral Video
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>“Deepfakes,” fake videos or photos doctored to look real, are a form of disinformation that have seen a troubling proliferation in recent months. Used to make it look like an individual (often a politician or entertainment celebrity) saying or doing something that they haven’t done in real life, they are becoming easier for anyone with the right technology to create. With new cutting-edge <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-ai-deepfake-can-fabricate-a-video-of-you-from-a-single-photo-mona-lisa-cheapfake-dumbfake/">facial recognition technology developed by Samsung</a>, for instance, an individual could make a depfake video using a single picture of their target. In May, thousands of Americans <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/doctored-pelosi-video-highlights-the-threat-of-deepfake-tech/">were misled into believing</a> the authenticity of “shallowfakes” or simpler modified and slowed videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in which she appeared to be drunk and slurring her speech. These videos, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1131728912835383300">one of which</a> was tweeted by President Donald Trump, are some of a growing number of altered videos that have been created by politically motivated individuals and groups to discredit their opponents.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Government agencies, news outlets, and social media companies have noticed a huge spike of disinformation on social media platforms following April’s general elections in Indonesia. The government has <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-indonesia-election-socialmedia/indonesia-curbs-social-media-blaming-hoaxes-for-inflaming-unrest-idUKKCN1SS1MM">temporarily halted</a> the uploading of certain images and videos on sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp after posts making false claims and inciting violence increased exponentially in May. The spread of disinformative hate speech has likely contributed to riots that have killed at least six people as of late May, formed in response to the reelection of President Joko Widodo.</p>

            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Under political pressure from the Trump Administration, digital tech giant Google has decided to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-alphabet-exclusive-idUSKCN1SP0NB">end part of its business</a> with Chinese telecoms manufacturer Huawei. This means that future buyers of Huawei smartphones and other products will no longer be able to download Google made apps or services; Gmail, YouTube and the Chrome browser will be unavailable. However current owners of a Huawei device will still be able to receive updates on their Google software, and future users of Huawei hardware will still be able to access Google’s open-source features like the Android Open-Source Project. The announcement from Google comes after Huawei has received criticism from western governments for years for allegedly stealing the information and intellectual property of its users and providing it to China and other autocratic governments.</p>

Though Facebook <a href="https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c">confirmed that it has removed pages and accounts</a> linked to the Archimedes Group, it has not stated what individual, group, or government, if any, had hired the company to disrupt the recent polls in places like Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo.</p>

              The Dawn of a New Strategy of Iranian Disinformation: Ephemeral Disinfo
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>A network of likely Iranian-linked social media bots and fake accounts has been discovered attempting to sow divisiveness and criticism of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. This new initiative, called “Endless Mayfly” by a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/">new report</a> from The Citizen Lab, is one of the largest attempts by Iran (or allied or proxy groups) to spread disinformation. Though similar in nature to attempts by Russian agents, this disinformation campaign was novel in that once fake accounts posted false stories and gained traction, they were quickly deleted. After these fake stories or reports had gained a significant amount of notoriety, the Endless Mayfly account operators then changed the link destination from a given false story to the legitimate website of the news organization or academic institution that the post was imitating. This strategy of “ephemeral” disinformation has the dual effect of obscuring the original source of a fake story, as well as giving the appearance that a fake story is linked to, or even created by, legitimate groups.</p>

        <p>A malicious software code that allows third-party individuals or groups to monitor the activity of a user’s smartphone activity were <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab">discovered</a> on the devices of some users of the communication application WhatsApp. This spyware, developed by the Israeli intelligence software company NSO Group, is spread by calling targets via the WhatsApp dial call function, even if the target does not answer the call. WhatsApp said it was acting quickly as of May to close the app’s vulnerability to the malicious surveillance software. Many targeted individuals are human rights advocates.</p>

        <p>As the European Union prepared for its continent-wide parliamentary elections in May, Facebook’s elections “war-room” for the continent was hard at work defending the polls from misinformation on the social media platform, a practice that has been repeated in the U.S. midterm elections, Brazil and Ukraine in the past year. In the wake of this work, Richard Allan, the company’s vice-president for public policy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/05/facebook-admits-huge-scale-of-fake-news-and-election-interference">said the company took down 2.8 billion fake accounts between October 2017 and November 2018</a>, signalling the scale of the problem and the need for global responses.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) released a <a href="https://www.ned.org/foreign-authoritarian-influence-western-balkans/">new report</a> that focuses on the role of foreign governments in undermining the relatively recent democratic norms in the states of the Western Balkans of Europe. The report details the efforts of neighboring autocracies like Russia and Turkey, which have long histories of involvement in the region, as well as newer players like China and Persian Gulf States. These governments have allied with local elites who share their goal of undermining liberal democracy in the region. The motives for upending Balkan democracy range from Russia wanting to prevent further NATO membership, to China attempting to secure more lucrative economic deals without oversight from local regulatory bodies.</p>

        <p>A <a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2019/study-journalists-need-help-covering-misinformation/">new study</a> conducted by the Institute for the Future has uncovered a disturbing truth about America’s journalists, namely that they are just as susceptible to falling for misinformation as any other group in the United States. More than 80% of more than 1000 journalists that were surveyed affirmed that they had been fooled by misinformation online. What’s more, only 15% reported having received any work-related training on how to spot online misinformation. The report further found that older Americans were more likely to be fooled than their younger counterparts.</p>

        <p>Responding to the threat of misinformation on its platform during electoral cycles in democracies across the world, social media giant Twitter has <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/strengthening-our-approach-to-deliberate-attempts-to-mislead-vot.html">announced</a> the introduction of a new reporting mechanism in a company blog post. Through this new reporting mechanism, individual users can report false or misleading information about elections to company administrators, who will then respond accordingly, including removing the reported content. The introduction of this policy comes as Twitter prepares to receive an influx of millions of tweets about the Lok Sabha elections in India and the continent-wide European Parliamentary election.</p>

The system, called ECU-911, has been used by both domestic Chinese law enforcement authorities, as well as the intelligence agencies of countries like Ecuador, which purchases the system from China. The system is an interconnected set of thousands of cameras that has been billed as a way to prevent violent crime throughout a given country, but has been accused by rights activists as a way for national governments to spy on their citizens.</p>

Meanwhile, internet censorship is flourishing, and biometrics are being abused by governments across the world. The report centered around three central “spotlights”: the need for better machine decision making, ways to rethink the online ad economy, and the rise of smart cities.</p>

        <p>On the heels of March’s Ukrainian presidential election, closely watched for signs of a concerted disinformation campaign by Russian linked entities, Finland held elections in April. As the country with the longest border with Russia of any EU member state, Finland also has an unfortunate history of being on the receiving end of attacks and coercion from its next-door neighbor. Things seem to be no different in the era of internet trolling from Twitter bots, and Finnish national security analysts have noted that Russian-linked social media accounts that spread false information <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-03-28/eu-s-bulwark-to-russia-mounts-defenses-against-election-meddling?__twitter_impression=true">remain a problem.</a> However, Finland has the benefit of a highly educated population, with above-average levels of internet literacy, making it somewhat more resistant to disinformation campaigns.</p>

        <p>The use of social media and video-streaming platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Vimeo, etc. have become ways for individuals to spread images and footage of mass violence like that of the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings in March. In response, the president of Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280914/microsoft-moderation-new-zealand-shooting-social-media">has suggested</a> creating a “joint virtual command center” to quickly respond to postings of such heinous acts. In a blog post, the industry leader has suggested that certain emergency situations like the New Zealand massacre be deemed “major events” that would warrant all companies providing social media or video-streaming services to work together on a temporary flag-and-remove campaign for offensive content regarding the event. Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/">followed this with an announcement</a> that it would be removing all content relating to white supremacy or separatism posted by users of its platform starting in April.</p>

              Israeli Tech Firm Sold Monitoring Software to Saudi Security Services Used to Track Down Dissidents like Jamal Khashoggi

        <p>NSO Group, a little-known Israeli tech developer, created “Pegasus,” an incredibly sophisticated software program that can allow users to spy on the mobile phones of others, even when those phones are encrypted. While the technology has been credited with saving lives by foiling terrorist attack and shutting down drug and human trafficking rings, it has also been used by autocratic governments to track down and eliminate dissident citizens like Saudi Arabia’s Jamal Khashoggi. Recently, NSO cofounder Shalev Hulio <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interview-with-ceo-of-nso-group-israeli-spyware-maker-on-fighting-terror-khashoggi-murder-and-saudi-arabia-60-minutes/">sat down for an interview</a> with 60 Minutes to defend his company’s controversial product.</p>

              Indians Are Primarily Getting Their English-Language News from Their Phones - So WhatsApp Added a Fact-Checking Service
            </h3>

        </header>
        <p><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/our-research/india-digital-news-report">A new Reuters research report</a> co-conducted with Oxford University shows that more Indians than ever (68% of those polled in the study) are receiving the bulk of their English-language online news from their mobile phones rather than computers or other devices. The report showed that social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp were the biggest mediums for accessing news for Indians, rather than directly going to the news source’s website. This has in turn prompted <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/tech/whatsapp-india-tip-line-election/index.html">WhatsApp to roll out a new feature</a> for its users in India ahead of this spring’s national elections. The feature, a tip line called Checkpoint, will allows users to submit messages, pictures or videos that they want checked, and Checkpoint employees will verify their accuracy.</p>

Now in the fifth year of a civil war that has demolished much of the eastern part of the country, Ukraine has also been the victim of a calculated, intensive disinformation campaign by Russia, which backs separatist rebels fighting the Ukrainian government. The new “Learn to Discern” program aims to teach Ukrainian schoolchildren to spot stories, photos, videos and other media that are false narratives appropriated by Russian government sources.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Ever more attention is being turned to the increasing prevalence and potency of private information intelligence companies in the wake of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/">report published earlier this year,</a> detailing the work of a for-profit American firm on behalf of the Qatari government. A recent New York Times report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html">revealed</a> that as former state intelligence agents retire or defect from their agencies, private firms offer them employment on projects spying on behalf of corporations or smaller countries without the resources to operate a sophisticated spy network of their own. While these “internet mercenary” groups have been used to help stop Middle Eastern based terrorists, and violent drug traffickers in places like Mexico, they are also being used by autocratic regimes like Qatar to track rights-activists and journalists.</p>

        <p>Vladimir Putin’s regime is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613138/russia-wants-to-cut-itself-off-from-the-global-internet-heres-what-that-really-means/amp/">set to start testing</a> the feasibility of cutting off the nation’s internet servers from the global internet. While Putin’s United Russia party insists that the motivation for this is to increase Russian internet self-sufficiency, regime critics and internet rights activists argue that it is a move designed to eliminate Russian citizens’ access to international news and commentary that is critical of the regime. This action would not only be bold and technically complicated, but also a major setback to internet freedom in Russia.</p>

These accounts utilize a combination of memes, pop-culture, and posts of videos from Infowars -a conspiracy-peddling website that is banned on Facebook, and Twitter.</p>

              The Strange Case of the “Deepfake” Conspiracy Surrounding Gabon’s President
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>When Gabon’s longtime leader Ali Bongo addressed his nation via internet video at the beginning of 2019, observers noted that something seemed off. Multiple observers noted that the president seemed to have unnatural eye and jaw movements, and a radically different speaking pattern than in his earlier speeches. Gabonese opposition activists, politicians, and even some technology experts <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/deepfake-gabon-ali-bongo/">have acknowledged the possibility</a> that the video could have been a so-called “deepfake,” a deliberately doctored video or image of a person that shows them doing or saying something which never actually happened or was said. The claim is that the footage of Bongo - who has been in poor health, and out of the country since autumn of 2018 - was an edited video of someone other than the president, aired by his inner circle to dilute local fears of his death or resignation. While video and film experts who analyzed the clip have not said for sure that the Bongo address is a deepfake, they did not rule out that possibility.</p>

              Five Generations of Online Manipulation
            </h3>

        <p>In a piece for the Foreign Policy Research Institute about his upcoming book, scholar Clint Watts <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/03/five-generations-of-online-manipulation-the-evolution-of-advanced-persistent-manipulators/">identifies</a> five “generations” of intentional online manipulation by state, criminal, and political actors, while making some dire predictions of internet’s future. The first generation, “Disrupting the System,” revolved around hackers committed denial-of access attacks shutting down people’s access to the internet. The second, “Exploiting the System,” was all about extremist groups (ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc.) using the internet to gain followers, mainly through sites like Twitter, and Youtube. The third, “Distorting the System” was widely seen from Russian government sources deliberately spreading false and misleading information in western internet sources. The fourth, “Dominating the System” foresees a near-future when private companies, interest groups and political parties adopt Russian tactics to invent news on a mass scale to drive public narratives. The fifth, “Owning the System” will be in the medium-to-long-term future, when authoritarian regimes begin to disconnect their national networks from the world wide web, leaving their subjects to consume only government-approved online media.</p>

        <p>Users and moderators on Reddit <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/reddit-coordinated-chinese-propaganda-trolls">have noticed a troubling trend</a> in the past few months: Reddit accounts allegedly linked to China are engaging in massive collective activity to drown out posts or threads that are critical of the Chinese government, nation, or the Communist Party. Canadian Reddit users in particular have noticed a sharp uptake of Chinese based or associated accounts on the site voting-down or posting negative comments on pages that have an anti-PRC government theme.</p>

        </header>
        <p>When the government of Zimbabwe launched a large hike in fuel prices easier this year, large protests prompted the state to shutter all internet resources in a nation-wide web media blackout. In response, more Zimbabweans than ever <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/whatsapp-has-come-in-to-fill-the-void-in-zimbabwe-the-future-of-news-is-messaging/">began to turn to the communications application WhatsApp</a> to get their news, including reports of coordinated government use of violence against protestors. These “e-[news]papers” are sent by WhatsApp text message, complete with photos and often even soundbites, to the phones of thousands of Zimbabwean subscribers. Though e-papers delivered via WhatsApp have existed since at least the ousting of former national president Robert Mugabe in late-2017, they are becoming ever more common in a country where the traditional media space has slowly closed over the years.</p>

        <p>Facial recognition software grows in sophistication every year, but this isn’t accomplished without giving AI “practice”: Researchers often upload millions of pictures of human faces to the recognition software that they are developing so that their programs can further develop the algorithms needed to achieve greater face-sensing capacity. Often, the pictures the systems utilize are provided by corporations such as IBM, who take the photos from photography websites like Flickr. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921">When interviewed by NBC News,</a> some photographers were alarmed or disturbed that the photos they had taken of others might be used to electronically profile those individuals. These photographers complained that IBM had not sought their permission to use the photos, nor the permission of their artistic subjects.</p>

        <p>Seeking to improve his company’s beleaguered reputation, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">released a blog post</a> in early March in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18253458/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy-encrypted-messaging-whatsapp-messenger-instagram">committed the company to the use of end-to-end encryption for its Messenger application.</a> This may or may not assuage the fears of many online privacy advocates, who voiced grave concerns earlier this year when Facebook announced that it would merge the operating systems of Messenger with those of WhatsApp, a secure messaging service it has acquired. Critics fear that end-to-end encryption could be removed or modified during the merger, giving governments, nefarious actors, and Facebook itself greater access to track the messages of users.</p>

        <p>Leaked internal documents from Facebook show that the social media company has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment?CMP=share_btn_tw">engaged in a high-level lobbying campaign</a> with some of Europe’s most powerful politicians. The exposed memos describe a strategy through which company COO Sheryl Sandberg, a popularly known motivational speaker, used her influence and prestige to convince the political elite in European Union countries to repeal their extant information-privacy laws. Targeted politicians included former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, and former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny.</p>

        <p>Facebook has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/ads-with-political-content-ukraine?__tn__=-UKH-R">announced a new policy</a> for its users in Ukraine, wherein they must register to promote political ad content on the social media platform. To register, individuals must provide valid identification and enroll in two-factor identification system, while also agreeing to let all of their political content posted to Facebook contain a label that reads “paid for by (organization name here).” This move is likely a way to safeguard against disinformation in the lead-up to national elections this year.</p>

            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>On December 7, 2018, the D4D Coalition Advisory Board issued a <a href="https://d4dcoalition.org/news/D4D-Coalition-Advisory-Board-Stands-in-Solidarity-with-Fellow-Member-Maria-Ressa-and-Rappler.html">statement of solidarity</a> condemning the indictment of fellow Advisory Board member and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. In light of Maria Ressa’s arrest on February 13, 2019, on charges of cyber libel, the Coalition reaffirms the solidarity expressed in that statement, and reiterates its condemnation of efforts by Philippine government to silence Rappler. The charges stem from a seven-year-old story that predates the enactment of the 2012 Cybercrime Prevention Act. The arrest follows a <a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/84-documents/218088-document-arrest-warrant-maria-ressa-tax-caseD4D-Coalition-Advisory-Board-Stands-in-Solidarity-with-Fellow-Member-Maria-Ressa-and-Rappler.html">string of charges</a> leveled against Ressa by the Philippine government, which are part of a broader attempt to silence independent and critical voices in the country. For her work as a guardian in the war against truth, Ressa was named one of <a href="http://time.com/person-of-the-year-2018-the-guardians/">Time Magazine’s 2018 Persons of the Year</a> and was the 2018 recipient of the Committee to Protect Journalism’s Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. Today the D4D Coalition echoes Ressa’s remarks upon accepting the award, “The time to fight for journalism . . . is now.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/facebook-elections/exclusive-facebook-brings-stricter-ads-rules-to-countries-with-big-2019-votes-idINKCN1PA0BW">Facebook announced the extension of content policies and tools</a> regarding upcoming elections in Nigeria, the European Union, India and Ukraine. The company is planning an ad hoc approach of restrictions on those who can advertise electoral ads before elections in Nigeria and Ukraine, as well as the creation of an online library of electoral ads in India.  Later in January, the social media platform <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools">blocked tools developed by ProPublica</a> and other media watchdogs, leading to criticism of Facebook from these groups, as well as lawmakers concerned with internet privacy. For over a year and a half, ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news agency, had been compiling information on hundreds of thousands of advertisements appearing on Facebook, detailing the identity of the ads’ sponsors, as well as who the ad might be targeting, with a software tool. In response to Facebook’s blockage, Mozilla Foundation then <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/eu-misinformation/">penned an open letter</a> to Facebook condemning the action, which was signed by several e-media freedom groups. After garnering significant negative press from this open letter, facebook VP <a href="https://twitter.com/robleathern/status/1095020163127115776">Rob Leathrern announced via Twitter</a> that it would do more to disclose the sourcing of political ads for upcoming polls in the critical upcoming elections.</p>

            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>After Facebook <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools">blocked access to transparency tools</a> allowing users to see how they are targeted by advertisers, Mozilla Foundation and co-signatories, including D4D-affiliated groups, released an <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/eu-misinformation/">open letter to Facebook</a> calling for specific, time-bound action to improve political ad transparency on the social media platform ahead of the European parliamentary elections. In response, Facebook committed to opening its Ad Archive API in March, and reaffirmed its intention to roll out additional ad transparency tools globally by June. The D4D Coalition’s <a href="https://d4dcoalition.org/news/Mozillas-Open-Letter-to-Facebook-and-the-Responsibility-of-the-Tech-Community-to-Do-No-Democratic-Harm.html">post</a> regarding the events noted that the challenges relating to ad transparency are global in nature. Too often, tools and policies to address transparency concerns have been rolled out primarily in countries where tech companies have a large market, or face the largest political risk. The D4D post references the notion that tech companies have an obligation to “do no democratic harm” and that protecting the abuse of social media platforms in the context of elections should not be driven by market size or political risk to the company. Indeed, new or restored democracies may be the least resilient to disinformation and have the greatest need for protection. The post appreciated Facebook’s commitment to roll out a global response to the issue of political ad transparency by the end of June.</p>

        <p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/">has accused an intelligence network</a> called Project Raven of working for and out-of the United Arab Emirates by spying on the perceived enemies of that state’s government, including American citizens. The cybersecurity company hired by Abu Dhabi to conduct the espionage, called CyberPoint, is an American group and employees many former National Security Agency employees. While in 2016 Project Raven shifted to the control of an Emirati cyber company, Dark Matter, a good number of the American employees remained with the team. Though interviewees stated that some of the main targets of Project Raven were violent extremist groups like the Islamic State, several other targets included journalists, human-rights campaigners and other dissidents of the UAE government; Project Raven began in 2009.</p>

        <p>Russia’s powerful media regulation agency, Roskomnadzor, has <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/russia-suing-facebook-twitter">initiated fines against social media giants Facebook and Twitter</a>. While the state-run agency claims that this action is in response to a violation by both companies of Russian communications laws, it is widely understood to be politically motivated. The Kremlin has a history of intimidating and punishing media and communications companies that do not comply with its laws that are designed to deprive users of online data privacy. Facebook and Twitter have refused to submit to Roskomnadzor demands to disclose the personal data of their Russian users.</p>

India was home to the highest number of forwarded photos, messages and videos, resulting in over 24 murders by violent mobs which had been incited on the app. After an initial success with the new cap in India, WhatsApp decided to extend this limit to all of its global users. The company hopes that this change will refocus users on the app’s original purpose: communication with close contacts.</p>

These pages appeared to be promoting groups with special interests from regional cuisine to politicians, however they promoted the Kremlin media’s stories and agenda, increasing Sputnik’s reach by 170%.</p>

        <p>Facebook has invited researchers to study some of its inner workings and develop proposals that would improve the company’s work on disinformation, hate speech and democracy. <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-01/Garton_Ash_et_al_Facebook_report_FINAL_0.pdf">This report offers nine recommendations</a> for Facebook’s policies, engagement with disinformation and impact on governance, including: clarifying its community standards on hate speech, hiring content reviewers with knowledge of cultural contexts, increasing transparency around the enforcement of policies in complicated cases, and expanding the context and fact-checking information provided for users. The same group also studied <a href="http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2018/the-impact-of-greater-news-literacy/">the Impact of Greater News Literacy</a> in societies as well as the connection between news literacy and other behaviors connected to media consumption online.</p>

        <p>Amnesty International and Element AI’s crowd-sourced data project, Troll Patrol, monitored <a href="https://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/troll-patrol/findings">tweets sent to 778 journalists and politicians from the U.S. and U.K.</a> during 2017. The study found that women from both sides of the political spectrum and both professions, journalists and politicians, were all targets for harassment. The project also found that 7.1% of the tweets monitored in the study registered as “problematic” or “abusive”. This percentage was higher for women of color, especially for black women, who were 84% more likely than their white peers to be talked about in abusive or problematic tweets.</p>

        <p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/business/china-internet-censor.html">the Chinese government requires that companies censor their own online information,</a> a market for internet censorship is on the rise, employing thousands of Chinese workers. These censorship factories teach their workers about legitimate past events and people so that they can recognize and moderate the content viewed by over 800,000 million users. The market for online content management extends beyond China; U.S. companies including Facebook and YouTube have announced that they plan to hire thousands of employees to help manage their content.</p>

The Commission cited fears of violence, intimidation, propaganda, and rumors surrounding the election that could lead to misinformation and voter suppression. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose ruling party retained power via a landslide victory in the elections, has been marred by allegations of mass arrests and jailing of activists and critics, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.</p>

They suggest that organized social media campaigns targeted the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), its candidates and President Tsai Ing-wen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/world/asia/taiwan-elections-meddling.html">during local elections in November</a>.

Platforms such as Instagram and YouTube have received less attention in the media, but were also found to have been used by groups such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, while the researchers also suggested that social media platforms would need to share more data to fully understand the full scope of the campaigns.

        <p>D4D network partner International IDEA has entered into a collaboration with the Electoral Tribunal of Panama in order to provide support to the newly created Digital Media Unit. The unit’s mandate is twofold. On one side, it is in charge of the online communication of the Tribunal in terms of Electoral information, providing a key line of information to the population through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp with the key electoral information. On the other, the Digital Media Unit is spearheading the fight against disinformation, with a 24/7 monitoring of social media war room, supporting the Tribunal to detect electoral offenses, campaigns to raise awareness around the dangers of spreading disinformation and engagement with diverse stakeholders to protect the electoral integrity. The Unit has also been in charge of launching the country’s first Digital Ethics Pact, encouraging the population to make responsible use of social media during the electoral campaign. International IDEA support will continue until the elections in May 2019 and beyond, aiming to position the Unit as the leader in the fight against disinformation in Panama.</p>

However, a spokesperson for U.S. forces tweeted that they had no involvement. The government narrative was bolstered by photos of wounded security officers which were exposed to have been taken years prior.</p>

        <p>At the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/27/tech/facebook-hearing-damian-collins/index.html">Inaugural Grand Committee on Disinformation</a>, an empty chair was left for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who turned down invitations to testify before the international committee of lawmakers. In his place, Facebook Vice President Richard Allan faced hard-hitting questions about email communication found within documents seized by the UK parliament and Facebook’s role in global democracy challenges. At the close of the hearing, members of parliament from around the world signed a declaration of <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/declaration-internet-17-19/">‘Principles of the Law Governing the Internet.’</a> Simultaneously, MP Damian Collins, Chair of the UK parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, pressured, under threat of imprisonment, the founder of the social media application developer Six4Three to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/tech/facebook-damian-collins-six4three/index.html">hand over internal Facebook documents</a> and emails, which have now been released by the committee and demonstrate its policy development, strategy and internal deliberations over data sharing with third-party developers, among other issues.</p>

        <p>In an attempt to increase transparency of political ads ahead of the 2019 EU Parliamentary Elections, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/23/18108623/google-eu-parliamentary-elections-political-ad-rules-transparency">Google has announced new policies</a> that will require ad posters name the organization that provides their funding. The parameters for a ‘political ad,’ however, are too narrow to capture much of the politically motivated content that is expected throughout the election period, sparking worry that these new policies will prove ineffective.</p>

        <p>An independent BSR report, commissioned by Facebook, about the impact of the platform on the human rights crisis in Myanmar found evidence that <a href="https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/bsr-facebook-myanmar-hria_final.pdf">Facebook did not take enough action to prevent violence from being spread on its site</a>. Thousands of people have died in the conflict, with hundreds of thousands more displaced internally and into neighboring Bangladesh. The report warns Facebook of future human rights abuses around the 2020 elections and calls for the company to both create a new human rights policy and enforce its current hate speech policies by working with the local authorities.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The Harvard University Shorenstein Center for Media Studies published <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/the-fight-against-disinformation-in-the-u-s-a-landscape-analysis/">The Fight Against Disinformation in the U.S.: A Landscape Analysis</a>, which explores the key players, tactics, and support for learning and programmatic responses to viral digital culture. Societal changes impact the way that we use media, but these shifts are in all directions. When the way that people communicate changes, this is reflected in a shift in society as well. The paper discusses the impacts of the changes in media use on American culture and the ways in which some people are trying to combat the negative impact of computational propaganda, disinformation and other harmful forms of content.</p>

        <p>In new research from Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center, Henry Farrell and Bruce Schneier argue that nations <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273111">should approach disinformation as they approach other issues of state security</a>. Different vulnerabilities are presents and potential responses are required depending on the type of government structure; autocracy or democracy. While autocracies produce contested knowledge about political actors themselves, democracies produce contested information about who holds power. This causes democracies to be more susceptible to narratives about general political organization.</p>

        <p>First seen in China, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/venezuela-zte/">Venezuela has adopted an RFID smart card system</a> that allows the government to track citizen behavior. This Fatherland Card, made by Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp, collects information including healthcare data, voting participation, and subsidized food distribution in a central database. In a country where many citizens rely on government programs to feed their families and receive medical care, opponents are calling the government’s requirement that citizens obtain the Fatherland card to access services akin to blackmail.</p>

Artisanal and Industrial strategies are usually taken by for-profit internet media companies, Artisanal by smaller platforms like Vimeo, Industrial by larger platforms like Google. Meanwhile, Community-Reliant strategies are taken by platforms like Reddit where platform consumers are also the main content generators.</p>

In response to suspicious pro-Saudi Arabian government tweets, Twitter suspended suspected bots that tweeted and re-tweeted identical talking points including “#unfollow_enemies_of_the_nation.” Twitter also released 11 million tweets believed to be from state-backed information operations originating in Russia and Iran. Facebook pages that appeared to be for Women’s Marches were found to originate in Bangladesh and sought to sell march-related merchandise.</p>

Included in the data are two accounts that had not been part of earlier releases, and are thought by Twitter to be state-backed. In total, information about 3,841 accounts connected to the IRA in Russia and 770 other accounts have been released to the public. However, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/russian-twitter-bots-coachella-taco-bell">researchers found even more fake Twitter accounts</a> that appear to be linked to the Russian government that were not identified by Twitter’s search, promoting politically benign topics such as Taco Bell and Coachella.</p>

        <p>Data &amp; Society published a report on “<a href="https://datasociety.net/output/weaponizing-the-digital-influence-machine/">Weaponizing the Digital Influence Machine: The Political Perils of Online Ad Tech</a>”. The paper further explains the relationship between politics, media, and ill-meaning actors. It lays out the tactics, technologies, and conditions that anti-democratic and politically-motivated actors use to weaponize digital advertising. The report finds that three main strategies are employed by actors who use the “Digital Influence Machine” to attempt to divide an opponent’s supporters, leverage behavioral science techniques to influence consumers, and mobilize those who support their views by threatening their identity, political or otherwise.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/opinion/brazil-election-fake-news-whatsapp.html">New York Times op-ed</a>, researchers and fact checkers in Brazil called on WhatsApp to make changes to its system when they found that it was being widely used to spread disinformation in the runup to the national election. A poll found that 44 percent of Brazilians use WhatsApp to read political news, and a growing amount of misinformation and disinformation has been shared widely through the app, and the writers called on the company to restrict forwards, broadcasts and limit the size of new groups in Brazil during the election period. A Facebook subsidiary, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/whatsapp-bans-100-000-accounts-before-brazilian-electio-1829886723">WhatsApp later banned over 100,000 accounts</a> associated with sharing false stories, but did not take up the suggestions before the election on October 28th.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of members of the Myanmar military, posing as civilians and often using tactics modeled after those used by Russia, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html">used Facebook to spread disinformation about the Muslim Rohingya minority</a>. One of the largest forced human migration human history, over 700,000 people, is widely attributed to this type of anti-Rohingya propaganda and the violence it incited. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, reported that the company found “clear and deliberate attempts to covertly spread propaganda that were directly linked to the Myanmar military.”</p>

        <p>A vulnerability in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussions-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194">Google+ profiles opened user data to 438 applications</a> between 2015 and March 2018, when the problem was discovered as part of an internal audit. This data breach resulted from a flaw in an API that was created by the tech company to allow developers to access profile information about individuals who used their apps and had given permission to share their profile data. Internal memos, investigative journalism, and a <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/?mod=article_inline">blog post</a> shed light on Google’s decision to not go public with the information when it originally discovered the problem. Increased security measures including the termination of the Google+ service occurred in hopes of rectifying the problem. CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress on the breach in the near future.</p>

The Summit provided an opportunity to share information about the Coalition with other groups sharing similar objectives, including the Global Tech Accountability Network, a new initiative arising out of the <a href="https://progressivevoicemyanmar.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Burmese-NGOs-to-Facebook-April-2018.pdf">#DearMark letter</a>, led by organizations in Myanmar.   Among the areas of collaboration discussed were the development of an open data standard on social media monitoring, together with a platform implementing the standard, for social media monitoring organizations to adapt to their own specific needs.  The use of shared tools and data standards provides an opportunity for social media monitoring groups to share data with like-minded, trusted partners in other countries, providing a more complete picture of hate speech or disinformation in a regional or global context.  In addition, the Summit provided an opportunity to connect with D4D partners, g0v and CoFacts, which is working with the Coalition to adapt the CoFacts fact-checking chatbot from LINE to FB Messenger and WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>The Oxford Internet Institute Computational Propaganda Project found that <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news/releases/new-report-shows-that-swedish-election-second-only-to-us-in-proportion-of-junk-news-shared/">the upcoming Swedish election has experienced a high amount of ‘junk news’</a> shared by users on social media sites, second only to that seen in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Some of these fake sites are modeled after reputable news sources, complicating users’ search for truth. Researchers were surprised to learn that eight of the ten most-shared fake news sites were domestic, causing a renewed focus on local actors over international influences.</p>

        <p>The Chinese government has created a national-level platform, run by the ‘Internet Illegal Information Reporting Center’ and run by Xinhua to publicly differentiate fact from fake news for its citizens. To create the platform, over 40 “rumor-refuting platforms” were combined into the official platform. The purpose behind the creation of this new official fact-checker, state-run xinhuanet.com explains, was to <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/29/c_137428781.htm">stop rumors and illegal information from disturbing the social order</a>.</p>

        <p>A Reuters special report documents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate/">more than 1,000 posts, comments, and crude images</a> on Facebook calling for violence and discrimination against Myanmar’s Muslims. Despite official rules banning such hate speech, Facebook appeared largely unprepared to crack down on this wave of anti-Muslim posts. For a long time, the organization lacked enough Burmese speaking employees, as well as programs that can effectively detect hate speech in the language and systems to translate the text, among other limitations preventing an effective response. It has also recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-facebook/facebook-bans-myanmar-army-chief-others-in-unprecedented-move-idUSKCN1LC0R7">blocked the accounts of 18 users and 52 pages that are linked to Myanmar’s military</a>, further highlighting the country’s worsening relationship with the world’s largest social media network.</p>

The tech company will offer free cybersecurity protections to likely targets of groups like APT28, including campaign offices and candidates, provided that they use Office 365 software.</p>

              European Union Tightens Grip on Google with Record-breaking Antitrust Fine

        <p>The European Union <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-be-fined-5-billion-by-eu-in-android-case-1531903470">issued Google a record-breaking antitrust fine</a> of €4.34 billion ($5.06 billion) over Google’s deals with mobile phone makers and telecommunications operators. According to EU regulators, Google’s contracts with phone makers effectively force those companies to prioritize Google apps and services in exchange for Google providing its Android operating system for free. The fine represents a major step towards stronger government oversight of technology companies, at least in the EU.</p>

        <p>The parliament of Uganda temporarily <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uganda-social-media-tax-stays-for-now/">maintained a controversial tax on social media use</a> despite widespread protests against it. President Museveni, who first introduced the law, has cited the spread of “gossip” as a key reason for its existence. Seen as an attempt at state censorship, the tax has led to a significant drop in social media use in addition to creating new economic burdens for the Ugandan people.</p>

Bot presence on Instagram continues to increase despite efforts by Facebook to curb the spread. The rise in Instagram bots is especially concerning since images and videos, uniquely difficult to track and identify, could play a larger role in coming elections.</p>

During the 2016 election, Arsov worked closely with several high-profile American partners to churn out over a hundred fake news websites on social media. Macedonian security agencies are now cooperating with law enforcement in the US and several other European countries to investigate possible ties between Arsov and the recently indicted Russian hackers.</p>

        <p>Research conducted by the German Tactical Technology Collective and their partners reveals that <a href="https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/whatsapp/">WhatsApp is now the primary platform for political messaging across the Global South</a>, especially in rural areas with limited internet access. The report analyzes this phenomenon, seeking to answer why WhatsApp is such a powerful tool, how politicians and campaigners use the platform, what strategies organizers use to exploit the platform and what the potential implications are of this trend. The report also includes several case studies of key countries impacted by WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>Vietnam recently <a href="https://www.cogitasia.com/vietnams-new-cyber-law-could-hobble-foreign-investors-and-limit-basic-freedoms/">approved a new controversial cybersecurity law</a> regulating technology firms’ use of personal data. The legislation requires that social media firms turn over subscriber information, IP addresses, and account information to the Ministry of Public Security and remove content from their platforms when requested by the government. The legislation also creates formulations for charging citizens for posting “anti-government propaganda” or any material that “incites violence and disturbs public security.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/wechatting-american-politics-misinformation-polarization-and-immigrant-chinese-media.php/">WeChat, a social media platform popular with Chinese Immigrants</a> in the United States, presents new challenges and a new perspective to the fight against misinformation. The platform heavily features local news and sensational stories, while passing over other popular topics including the economy and healthcare. WeChat shows many of the same characteristics as misinformation in mainstream media, but also displays ways in which immigrant populations diverge from norms because of its blend of U.S. media and Chinese media practices. On the platform, conservative voices feature loudly, with both liberal and conservative users discussing the role of Chinese immigrants in politics and in the United States.</p>
